# How install mod?
1. Go to this site (I have selected 1.16.5, which is the mod version): https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.16.5.html
2. Download 1.16.5 - 36.2.0 (Or click "Show All Versions", go to 36.2.0, and click the Info symbol (looks like this -> (i)) to directly download it, just to avoid ads)
3. Run the jar file
4. Go to the Java Edition install directory (C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft) and find a folder named "mods" (or make one)
5. Copy (or cut) and Paste RedWiresMod.jar into that folder
6. u done :)))
