For info on this mod, go to https://github.com/RedWirePlatinumTwo/RedWiresMinecraftMod/wiki

You can also download this on https://mcreator.net/modification/90290/redwires-miscellaneous-mod 

by the way the ONLY file you actually need to download is the jar file (and put it in your mods folder), which is why i didnt bother making "releases" or whatever
