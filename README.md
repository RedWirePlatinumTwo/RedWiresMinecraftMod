# How install mod?
1. Go to this site (I have selected 1.16.5, which is the mod version): https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.16.5.html
2. Download 1.16.5 - 36.2.0 (Or click "Show All Versions", go to 36.2.0, and click the Info symbol (looks like this -> (i)) to directly download it, just to avoid ads)
3. Run the jar file
4. Go to the Java Edition install directory (C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft) and find a folder named "mods" (or make one)
5. Copy (or cut) and Paste RedWiresMod.jar into that folder
6. u done :)))

#Does this mod have a specific theme?
no lol, I just thought of mod ideas in my head and then made it real

#What does this mod have?

#Weapons
-Lava Bow (Combine a Bow and a lava bucket with a smithing table, Put 3 lava buckets on the top row and 3 arrows on the mid row to craft arrows with a crafting table)
-Water Bow (Same as Lava Bow, but with Water Buckets)
-Exploding Bow (Combine a Bow and a TNT block with a Smithing table, Combine an arrow and a TNT block to get the arrows)
-Block-Placing bow (The block placed is based on the last slot of your hotbar, to craft it, you smith a bow and a Dispenser (currently don't know what would be a good recipe for getting a block placing bow)
-Real Knife (Unobtainable in Survival, deals 99 damage)

#Foods
-Cooked Egg
-Cooked Cactus (Green Dye is instead crafted like every other dye)

#Shitpost stuff
-Baguette (haha funny long bread, combinable with 2 breads and heals twice as much, as you'd probably expect)
-Uno Reverse Card (Like the thorns enchantment, but funni. Unobtainable in survival cause this would be way too OP. Gives you Regen II and Saturation for 3 seconds everytime you get hit just to attempt fully healing yourself when attacked. Not recommended to use against creepers.)
-gamerule doFunnyVineBoom (plays the vine boom sound effect when damaged.)
-gamerule doKillCreepers (I hate creepers, so I made this so a creeper instantly dies once they target you. If you find this OP, simply don't enable it lol)

#Items
Wither Spawn Egg
