# How install mod?
1. Go to this site (I have selected 1.16.5, which is the mod version): https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.16.5.html
2. Download 1.16.5 - 36.2.0 (Or click "Show All Versions", go to 36.2.0, and click the Info symbol (looks like this -> (i)) to directly download it, just to avoid ads)
3. Run the jar file
4. Go to the Java Edition install directory (C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft) and find a folder named "mods" (or make one)
5. Copy (or cut) and Paste RedWiresMod.jar into that folder
6. u done :)))

#Does this mod have a specific theme?
no lol, I just thought of mod ideas in my head and then made it real

# What does this mod have?

#Weapons
1. Lava Bow (Combine a Bow and a lava bucket with a smithing table, Put 3 lava buckets on the top row and 3 arrows on the mid row to craft arrows with a crafting table)
2. Water Bow (Same as Lava Bow, but with Water Buckets)
3. Exploding Bow (Combine a Bow and a TNT block with a Smithing table, Combine an arrow and a TNT block to get the arrows)
4. Block-Placing bow (The block placed is based on the last slot of your hotbar, to craft it, you smith a bow and a Dispenser (currently don't know what would be a good recipe for getting a block placing bow)
5. Real Knife (Unobtainable in Survival, deals 99 damage)

# Foods
1. Cooked Egg
2. Cooked Cactus (Green Dye is instead crafted like every other dye)

# Shitpost stuff
-Baguette (haha funny long bread, combinable with 2 breads and heals twice as much, as you'd probably expect)
-Uno Reverse Card (Like the thorns enchantment, but funni. Unobtainable in survival cause this would be way too OP. Gives you Regen II and Saturation for 3 seconds everytime you get hit just to attempt fully healing yourself when attacked. Not recommended to use against creepers.)
-gamerule doFunnyVineBoom (plays the vine boom sound effect when damaged.)
-gamerule doKillCreepers (I hate creepers, so I made this so a creeper instantly dies once they target you. If you find this OP, simply don't enable it lol)

# Items + Blocks
1. Wither Spawn Egg
2. Iron Golem Spawn Egg
3. Ender Dragon Spawn Egg
4. Raw Iron and Raw Iron Block
5. Raw Gold and Raw Gold Block (These were added purely because you can get more gold and iron with a Fortune Pickaxe)

# Potions (and effects)
1. Flying (brewable with a shulker shell)
2. Levitation (Use a Fermented Spider Eye and a potion of flying to get this)
3. Withering (Uses the wither rose to brew)
4. Invincibility (unbrewable in survival for blatantly obvious reasons)
